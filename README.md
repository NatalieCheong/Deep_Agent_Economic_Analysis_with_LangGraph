- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Advanced language models for intelligent economic interpretation
- **Multiple Analysis Types**: 
  - Economic Indicators Analysis
  - Market Analysis
  - Comparative Analysis
  - Economic Forecasting
  - Custom Query Analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**: Comprehensive statistical measures and trend analysis
- **Interactive Workflow**: LangGraph-powered agent orchestration for complex analysis tasks
- **Data Visualization**: Enhanced understanding through trend analysis and correlations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 
- FRED API key (free registration at [FRED API](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html))
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_api_key_here
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here  # Optional for web search
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üìä Usage

### Available Analysis Types

1. **Economic Indicators Analysis** - Analyze key economic indicators like GDP, unemployment, inflation
2. **Market Analysis** - Comprehensive market trend analysis
3. **Comparative Analysis** - Side-by-side comparison of multiple economic series
4. **Economic Forecast** - AI-powered economic forecasting and predictions
5. **Custom Query** - Ask specific economic questions and get detailed analysis

### Example Usage

```bash
üí¨ Enter your analysis request: 4  # Economic Forecast
```

The system will automatically:
- Identify relevant economic indicators
- Fetch real-time data from FRED
- Perform statistical analysis
- Generate comprehensive reports
- Provide actionable insights
